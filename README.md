# Starting the infrastructure applications
In order to start the infrastructure applications run `docker-compose up -d`.

Add the container id of the Kafka service to the local hosts file:
- For Windows 10 - "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
- For Linux - "/etc/hosts"

*After this the Angular and Spring Boot applications can be started*
